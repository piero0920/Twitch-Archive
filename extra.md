## Linux

## Explanation -- THIS IS OUTDATED
### Record live stream:
Using [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/) downloads the `.ts` file from the live stream since the script starred running, if the script was running since before the beginning of the stream, it will record everything and save it to: `/root_path/streamer_username/video/recorded/LIVE_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.ts`

This option will need a oauth-token to record without ADS.
After the stream ended, the `.ts` file will be processed to `.mp4` file. using [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and save it to: `/root_path/streamer_username/video/processed/LIVE_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.mp4`
> [Here's](https://youtu.be/1MBsUoFGuls) a tutorial that shows you how to get the oauth-token.
### Download VOD
Using [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/) downloads the `.ts` file from the VOD, the download is faster and is available to get the unmuted segments before twitch mutes the entire VOD. it will be save it to: `/root_path/streamer_username/video/recorded/VOD_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.ts`

Then the `.ts` file will be processed to `.mp4` file. using [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and save it to: `/root_path/streamer_username/video/processed/VOD_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.mp4`
This option will Download the latest public VOD, if the streamer hasn't published or has hide the VOD, the current VOD will no be downloaded instead the previous VOD.
### Download and render chat   
 Using [TwitchDownloaderCLI](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader) downloads the `.json` file of the chat logs from the VOD, ands saves it to: `/root_path/streamer_username/chat/json/CHAT_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.json`
 
 Then after the `.json` file is downloaded using again [TwitchDownloaderCLI](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader) renders it to a viewable `.mp4` file and saves it to:
 `/root_path/streamer_username/chat/rendered/CHAT_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.mp4`
 
 If you want to change the rendered settings go to [chat.bat](https://github.com/piero0920/Twitch-Archive/blob/main/main/chat.bat) file and change the parameters:
 `--background-color #FF111111 -w 500 -h 1080 --outline true -f Arial --font-size 22 --update-rate 1.0`
### Download metadata
Using a simple api request downloads the `.json` metadata of the latest VOD and saves it to:
`/root_path/streamer_username/metadata/metada_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.json`
### Upload to the cloud
Using [rclone](https://rclone.org/) after everything being downloaded and rendered , it will upload every file from the `root_path/streamer` folder  to any cloud storage supported by rclone such as [Google Drive, Mega, One Drive, etc.](https://rclone.org/overview/#features)
 The destination path to where it will be uploaded it has to be stated in the `.env` file.
 Example:
 ```env
remote=GoogleDrive:Archive
 ```
 ### Gmail notification
 Using the python library [smtplib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html) sends gmail messages to desire gmail. To be run correctly the emails have to be stated in the `.env` file.
 Example:
 ```.env
 SENDER=example@gmail.com 
 PWD=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 RECEIVER=example@gmail.com
 ```
 the `PWD` env is NOT your normal password is a 16 character password generated by google.

### Seccion finished
After every option if enabled is done it will go back to check again.
Here's an example of how a regular PATH will look like.
